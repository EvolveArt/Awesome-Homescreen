## Contributions

Thanks for your interest in Homescreen!

When contributing, please keep in mind the following guidelines:

- One project per pull request.
- New apps should be added to [apps.json](./src/apps.json), **DO NOT** edit README directly, README is generated automatically by github actions.
- Apps must be projects built to support Homescreen, including a resolver skylink in their Manifest that matches the resolver skylink of the Add to Homescreen link.
- Github links should match the author/builder of the application and support Homescreen by maintaining an official resolver skylink.
- Include a meaningful pull request description.
- Keep the project description short and simple without skimping on the important details.
- Projects should be organized in ascending alphanumeric order i.e. a-z, 0-9.

- Check that your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
